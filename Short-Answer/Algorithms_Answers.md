#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - with the way this is written, the function has to perform n operations every time it runs before it hits the limit specified by the while loop. making it O(n)

b) O(n^2) - if this were only performing one operation for each number leading up to N it would be O(n), but this is performing the operations within the while loop for each integer from 0 to n. doubling up our operations compaired to doing a single loop


c) O(n) - this is a recursive function that will call itself as many times as there are bunnies.
